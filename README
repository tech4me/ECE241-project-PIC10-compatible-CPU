This is an implementation of PIC10F202 microcontroller with output to VGA display.
It is tested on Altera DE1-SoC, with gpasm as assambler and PICC as C compiler.
The output of the assambler/compiler has to be intel hex8m and has to be processed by my HEX2HEX program, so that Quartus can use it.

File structure:
    cpu_core:       all the core components for PIC10F202
    cpu_watch:      a module that helps to debug cpu(output key information to HEX and LEDR)
    test_programs:  contains some asm and c program to test the cpu
    test_display:   this module is connected to cpu's GPIO to print ASCII character
    tools:          HEX2HEX source
